Milestone 3: Implementation (Tuesday 05/15/2018 4:30pm aaah)
src.zip, containing the source code of your system. Make sure to include all the files necessary to compile and run your system. In that zip file, include a file named README.txt with clear instructions to the grader on how to compile and run your project. As always, your code must be written with good style and be well documented.
gitlog.txt, containing your Git log.
design.pdf, which is an updated version of your design document:
Account for any changes made during implementation.
You do not need to submit a separate interfaces.zip for this milestone, because you're already submitting those files as part of src.zip.
Update the test plan to discuss what you accomplished and describe any known bugs.
Add a new section on Division of labor: Who implemented what? Write a paragraph for each team member describing their primary contributions to the implementation effort. Include an estimate of how many hours each person worked.



DEMO: ( Monday 05/14/2018 --- Friday 05/18/2018)
Here's the agenda for your demo:

Introductions and overview [2 min]: The staff member begins the meeting.
Background [3 min]: The team gives a brief reminder of project, especially highlighting any changes that might have occurred since the design phase.
Demo of system [24 min]: The team presents the implemented functionality, demoing the features of the system that are working, and discussing any planned functionality that wasn't completed. You must demo what you turned in as of the Milestone 3 deadline; sorry, but for fairness to other teams we can't allow you to continue improving the system after that.
Wrapup [1 min].
